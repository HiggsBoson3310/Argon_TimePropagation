# Argon_TimePropagation
Fortran and Python Code for photionization in Argon with ultrafast pulses <br>
<br>
In the <b> source </b> folder you will find the main driving fortran codes. They include generic mathematical routines, the split operator formula propagator, the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) routines for argon and multiple propagations making different variations on the included states in the hilbert space. <br>
<br>
In the folder <b> Python Radial Integrals </b> contains the routines used to compute the dipole matrix elements at the energies of the bound states computed with the MQDT subroutines. There are also specific routines that compute the dipoles for the specific symmetries.<br>
<br>
In the folder <b> Samples </b> you will find a notebook with some of the sample output of the calculation, the required files to run the notebook are not included due to the weight.
